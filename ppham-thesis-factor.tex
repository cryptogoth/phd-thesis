We present a 2D nearest-neighbor
quantum architecture for Shor's algorithm to factor an $n$-bit number in $O(\log^3n)$ depth.
Our implementation uses
%(1)
parallel phase estimation,
%(due to Kitaev, Shen, and Vyalyi),
%(2)
constant-depth fanout and teleportation,
%(due to Harrow, Fowler, and Taylor),
and
%(3)
constant-depth carry-save modular addition.
%(due to Gossett).
%We introduce a novel 2D architectural variation on Gossett's modular arithmetic
%and interleave constant-depth fanout and teleportation circuits for
%nearest-neighbor and long-distance communication channels, and ultimately use
%our circuit within parallel phase estimation to achieve quantum factoring.
We derive upper bounds on the circuit resources of our architecture under a
new 2D model which allows a classical controller and parallel, communicating
modules.
We provide a comparison to all previous nearest-neighbor factoring
implementations.  
Our circuit results in an exponential improvement in nearest-neighbor circuit depth at the cost of a polynomial increase in circuit size and width.
