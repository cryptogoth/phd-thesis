Quantum computing is a new field which combines
computer science and quantum physics. Its most
famous result, Shor's factoring algorithm,
would enable us to one day compromise the widely-used
RSA cryptosystem if we are able to
design efficient quantum architectures. Studying
the depth of these architectures would allow us
to solve this human problem within a human
lifetime. Toward that end, we contribute two
hybrid factoring architectures in
poly-logarithmic and sub-logarithmic depths,
which are both exponential improvements over previous
known works. We also present an improved
procedure for generating quantum Fourier states
useful for quantum compiling. Finally, we
invent a new circuit resource called coherence
which upper bounds the error-correcting effort
needed in a future quantum computer. We use this
to characterize a better time-space tradeoff
for factoring as well as to provide
configurable-depth factoring architectures.
