\chapter{Quantum Compiling}
\label{chap:qcompile}

Quantum compiling is the process of approximating arbitrary,
$n$-qubit unitary operations using a universal set which
is usually fixed, finite, and contains only single-qubit
and two-qubit gates. Like quantum architecture, quantum
compiling plays an intermediate role in between quantum
algorithms, which determine which gates to apply in a circuit,
and quantum error correction, which determines the
fault-tolerant gate set.
Quantum compiling helps mitigate one source of error,
the difference $\epsilon$ between a desired gate and its
finite approximation,
and consumes its own circuit resources, usually measured in
$(1 / \epsilon)$.
Therefore, it is important to study efficient quantum 
compiling so that we don't lose any quantum algorithmic speedups.
Most interestingly to this dissertation, quantum compiling itself
is an algorithm and can be mapped to a low-depth, nearest-neighbor
architecture. That is the subject of this chapter.

In Section \ref{sec:qcompile-bg}, we provide preliminary definitions
and key results in quantum compiling. We discuss both upper
and lower bound results, and the primary division of labor in
the literate: compiling single-qubit gates, and reducing
multi-qubit gates to single-qubit ones. We discuss the
two problems of approximating quantum gates and exact synthesis.
We also discuss the main techniques used in recent works
to improve the exponent in the SK works to meet the lower
bound.

In Section \ref{sec:ksv-resource}, we provide a pedagogical
review of the KSV algorithm, compared to the conventional SK
algorithm. We also calculate resources needed to implement
KSV on 2D CCNTCM.

In Section \ref{sec:ksv-error}, we discuss one particular
empirical optimization for quantum circuits, that of measuring
early. In the case of KSV quantum compiling, some
processing may be offloaded to a classical computer if one does
not perform coherent measurements. This trades off quantum
computer resources of circuit depth and size for width.

In Section \ref{sec:qcompile-misc}, we contribute several
results related to single-qubit quantum compiling. These
procedures are probabilistic and have some limitations.
One is not universal, the other does not compile to a
fixed basis. However, both may be useful as parts of
larger quantum compiling approaches in the future.

Finally, in Section \ref{sec:qcompile-conclude}, we present the results of
our comparison and conclude with interesting open problems and
future directions for results in this field.

We discuss the seminal work
in this field by Solovay-Kitaev \cite{Solovay1995} and a
parallelized version which trades circuit depth for circuit width
by Kitaev-Shen-Vyalyi \cite{Kitaev2002}. We discuss two primary
ways to divide up the problem of quantum compiling: 
compiling single-qubit gates, reducing multi-qubit gates to
single-qubit ones. We also provide a pedagogical review of
startling recent advances in quantum compiling
