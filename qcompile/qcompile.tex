\chapter{Quantum Compiling}
\label{chap:qcompile}

Quantum compiling can be described in two equivalent ways.
Like 
is the process of approximating arbitrary,
$n$-qubit unitary operations using a universal set which
is usually fixed, finite, and contains only single-qubit
and two-qubit gates. Like quantum architecture, quantum
compiling plays an intermediate role in between quantum
algorithms, which determine which gates to apply in a circuit,
and quantum error correction, which determines the
fault-tolerant gate set.
Quantum compiling helps mitigate one source of error,
the difference $\epsilon$ between a desired gate and its
finite approximation,
and consumes its own circuit resources, usually measured in
$(1 / \epsilon)$.
Therefore, it is important to study efficient quantum 
compiling so that we don't lose any quantum algorithmic speedups.
Most interestingly to this dissertation, quantum compiling itself
is an algorithm and can be mapped to a low-depth, nearest-neighbor
architecture. That is the subject of this chapter.

In Section \ref{sec:qcompile-bg}, we define the problem of
quantum compiling more rigorously and provide useful definitions
and notation for the rest of this chapter. We also discuss
variations of quantum compiling that are common in the
literature: exact synthesis versus approximation, and
single-qubit gates versus multi-qubit gates.

In Section \ref{sec:qcompile-sk}, we discuss the foundational
result in this field, the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm, and how it
continues to shape quantum compiler research. We also discuss
lower bounds on any SK-style appraoch to quantum compiling.
Building upon this,
In Section \ref{sec:qcompile-review}, we review the large
amount of recent literature on single-qubit quantum compiling with
constant width, representing
a startling amount of progress with the last year. We present
the cross-cutting themes of this research and provide an
at-a-glance comparison of all known single-qubit quantum compiling methods
to date in Section \ref{sec:qcompile-compare}.

As an alternative method of single-qubit quantum compiling,
in Section \ref{sec:qcompile-qfs} we
discuss a popular method of trading low depth for increased
width: combining phase kickback with a quantum Fourier state.
In Section \ref{sec:ksv}, we provide a pedagogical review
of the KSV algorithm for generating quantum Fourier states
useful for phase kickback. We also provide the calculation of
parameters necessary for any practical implementation as well as
the particular circuit resources consumed on \textsf{2D CCNTCM}.
We then compare the KSV approach to a recent alternative
by Jones which distills quantum Fourier states recursively \cite{Jones2013}.

In Section \ref{sec:qcompile-cd}, we contribute a method for
quantum compiling the single-qubit rotations needed for a
sublogarithmic depth quantum majority gate from Chapter \ref{chap:factor-sublog}.
Finally, in Section \ref{sec:qcompile-conclude}, we conclude by summarizing
the overall themes of quantum compiling and presenting interesting
directions for future research.

%We discuss the seminal work
%in this field by Solovay-Kitaev \cite{Solovay1995} and a
%parallelized version which trades circuit depth for circuit width
%by Kitaev-Shen-Vyalyi \cite{Kitaev2002}. We discuss two primary
%ways to divide up the problem of quantum compiling: 
%compiling single-qubit gates, reducing multi-qubit gates to
%single-qubit ones. We also provide a pedagogical review of
%startling recent advances in quantum compiling

%In the last year, many recent advances
