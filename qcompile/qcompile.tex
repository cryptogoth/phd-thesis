\chapter{Quantum Compiling}
\label{chap:qcompile}

Quantum compiling is the approximation of an $n$-qubit
unitary operation using a fixed, finite, universal set
of simpler gates. Like quantum architecture, quantum
compiling plays an intermediate role between quantum
algorithms (which determine the high-level gates in a circuit),
and quantum error correction (which determines the
fault-tolerant gate set).
Quantum compiling helps mitigate one source of error,
the difference $\epsilon$ between a desired gate and its
finite approximation,
and consumes its own circuit resources, usually measured in
$(1 / \epsilon)$.
Therefore, it is important to study efficient quantum 
compiling so that we don't lose any quantum algorithmic speedups.
Most interestingly to this dissertation, quantum compiling itself
is an algorithm and can be mapped to a low-depth, nearest-neighbor
architecture. That is the subject of this chapter.

In Section \ref{sec:qcompile-basis}, we provide the foundation
for quantum compiling by reviewing important quantum gates,
how circuits correspond to unitary matrices, distance metrics,
and universal gate sets.

In Section \ref{sec:qcompile-bg}, we rigorously define the problem of
quantum compiling and define useful notation and circuit resources.
We also discuss
variations and subtasks of quantum compiling that are common themes
in the literature, as well as their inter-relationships.
These themes include exact synthesis versus approximation,
single-qubit gates versus multi-qubit gates, and deterministic
versus randomized compiling procedures.

In Section \ref{sec:qcompile-sk}, we review the foundational
result in this field, the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm, and how it
continues to shape quantum compiler research. We also discuss
lower bounds on any SK-style approach to quantum compiling.
Building upon this,
in Section \ref{sec:qcompile-review}, we review the large
amount of recent literature on single-qubit quantum compiling with
constant width. We present
the cross-cutting themes of this research and provide an
at-a-glance comparison of all known single-qubit quantum compiling methods
to date in Section \ref{sec:qcompile-compare}.

As an alternative method of single-qubit quantum compiling,
in Section \ref{sec:qcompile-qfs}, we
discuss a popular method of trading low depth for increased
width: combining phase kickback with a quantum Fourier state.

In Section \ref{sec:qcompile-ksv}, we contribute an improved
algorithm for generating quantum Fourier states based on
Kitaev-Shen-Vyalyi \cite{Kitaev2002}. We also provide the calculation of
parameters necessary for any practical implementation as well as
the particular circuit resources consumed on \textsf{2D CCNTCM}.
We then compare the KSV approach to a recent alternative
by Jones which distills quantum Fourier states recursively \cite{Jones2013}.
Finally, in Section \ref{sec:qcompile-maj}, we contribute a method for
quantum compiling the single-qubit rotations needed for a
sublogarithmic depth quantum majority gate from Chapter \ref{chap:factor-sublog}.

The last two sections represent the main contributions of this chapter.

%Finally, in Section \ref{sec:qcompile-conclude}, we conclude by summarizing
%the overall themes of quantum compiling and presenting interesting
%directions for future research.
