\section{Circuit Coherence of Factoring Architectures}
\label{sec:cohere-factor}


From the previously best-known architectural depth of
$O(n^2)$, we improved the depth to $O(\log^2 n)$ in Chapter \ref{chap:factor-polylog},
and then even beneath that to $O((\log\log n)^2)$ in Chapter \ref{chap:factor-sublog}.
This last depth was limited only by the depth of quantum compiling a
single-qubit rotation for the quantum majority gate. However, the improvement
in depth came at the cost of increasing width and size.
For the polylogarithmic depth, we calculated a size and width of $O(n^4)$.
