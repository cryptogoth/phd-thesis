\chapter{Quantum Circuit Coherence}
\label{chap:coherence}

In the first two chapters, we presented low-depth nearest-neighbor
architectures for factoring an $n$-bit number. We improved the depth first to
be sublinear and then sublogarithmic, but at a polynomial increase in size
and width. This represents a time-space tradeoff which can be upper-bounded
by the product of the circuit depth and circuit width. Although the title of
this dissertation indicates that it is beneficial to decrease depth, in
experimental implementations, other practical considerations may constrain
our depth reduction.

Toward this end, we introduce a new circuit resource call \emph{coherence}
which quantifies the amount of error-correction that must be performed
to maintain a coherent quantum computing state. This can be analogous to
the amount of classical controller time or electrical power that a
quantum computing experiment consumes while running an algorithm. We
define our new resource in Section \ref{sec:cohere-def}, discuss its
relationship to other circuit resources on \textsf{2D CCNTCM}, and
calculate coherence for some simple examples to illustrate how it
captures the notion of parallelizability for a circuit.

Since circuit coherence measures a time-space tradeoff in order to
quantify circuit parallelism, it is natural to
compare it to other resources that are measured in the literature.
This is done in Section \ref{sec:coherence-tradeoff}, where we
especially review the model measurement-based quantum computing and
how it relates to circuit coherence.

In Section \ref{sec:cohere-factor}, we calculate the circuit coherence
for two arithmetic building blocks useful in factoring: addition
and multiplication. We use this to draw some conclusions about the
usefulness of decreasing the depth, and making the circuit depth configurable
so that an experimental architect can make the appropriate choice.

Finally, having exhausted our fascination with factoring,
we apply our low-depth techniques (compiling and circuit coherence)
to a new quantum algorithm: hamiltonian
simulation. In Section \ref{cohere-hs-bg}, we discuss the background of
this problem, and in Section \ref{cohere-hs-calc} we parallelize one
aspect of it, that of decreasing the depth of simulating
a $1$-sparse Hamiltonian matrix.
