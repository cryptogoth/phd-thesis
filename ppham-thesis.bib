	Abstract = {We show that the depth of quantum circuits in a realistic architecture where a classical controller determines which local interactions to apply on the (k)D grid ($\backslash$bbZ\^{}k) where (k $\backslash$geq 2) is the same (up to a constant factor) as in the standard model where arbitrary interactions are allowed. This allows minimum-depth circuits for the nearest-neighbor architecture to be obtained from minimum-depth circuits in the standard abstract model. Our work therefore justifies the standard assumption that quantum algorithms can perform interactions between arbitrary pairs of qubits. In particular, our results imply that Shor's algorithm, controlled operations and fan-outs can be implemented in constant depth, polynomial size and polynomial width in this architecture.   We also present optimal non-adaptive quantum circuits for controlled operations and fan-outs on a (k)D grid. These circuits have depth ($\backslash$Theta($\backslash$sqrt[k]\{n\})), size ($\backslash$Theta(n)) and width ($\backslash$Theta(n)). Our lower bound is for a general class of operations which includes controlled operations and fan-outs as special cases.},

Classically, we need logarithmic depth even if we can use unbounded fan-in gates. If we allow arbitrary one-qubit gates instead of a fixed basis, then these circuits can also be made exact in log-star depth. Sorting, arithmetical operations, phase estimation, and the quantum Fourier transform with arbitrary moduli can also be approximated in constant depth.},

@article{Bonderson2010,
	Abstract = {The advancement of information processing into the realm of quantum mechanics promises a transcendence in computational power that will enable problems to be solved which are completely beyond the known abilities of any "classical" computer, including any potential non-quantum technologies the future may bring. However, the fragility of quantum states poses a challenging obstacle for realization of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The topological approach to quantum computation proposes to surmount this obstacle by using special physical systems -- non-Abelian topologically ordered phases of matter -- that would provide intrinsic fault-tolerance at the hardware level. The so-called "Ising-type" non-Abelian topological order is likely to be physically realized in a number of systems, but it can only provide a universal gate set (a requisite for quantum computation) if one has the ability to perform certain dynamical topology-changing operations on the system. Until now, practical methods of implementing these operations were unknown. Here we show how the necessary operations can be physically implemented for Ising-type systems realized in the recently proposed superconductor-semiconductor and superconductor-topological insulator heterostructures. Furthermore, we specify routines employing these methods to generate a computationally universal gate set. We are consequently able to provide a schematic blueprint for a fully topologically-protected Ising based quantum computer using currently available materials and techniques. This may serve as a starting point for attempts to construct a fault-tolerant quantum computer, which will have applications to cryptanalysis, drug design, efficient simulation of quantum many-body systems, solution of large systems of linear equations, searching large databases, engineering future quantum computers, and -- most importantly -- those applications which no one in our classical era has the prescience to foresee.},

We expand on the first report of the experiment [1], including a detailed discussion of how the transport potentials were calculated. Two main mechanisms that caused motional excitation during transport are explained, along with the methods used to mitigate such excitation. We reduced the motional excitation below the results in Ref. [1] by a factor of approximately 50. The effect of a mu-metal shield on qubit coherence is also reported. Finally, we examined a method for exchanging energy between multiple motional modes on the few-quanta level, which could be useful for cooling motional modes without directly accessing the modes with lasers. These results establish how trapped ions can be transported in a large-scale quantum processor with high fidelity.},

	Abstract = {We prove that one-way quantum computations have the same computational power as quantum circuits with unbounded fan-out. It demonstrates that the one-way model is not only one of the most promising models of physical realisation, but also a very powerful model of quantum computation. It confirms and completes previous results which have pointed out, for some specific problems, a depth separation between the one-way model and the quantum circuit model. Since one-way model has the same computational power as unbounded quantum fan-out circuits, the quantum Fourier transform can be approximated in constant depth in the one-way model, and thus the factorisation can be done by a polytime probabilistic classical algorithm which has access to a constant-depth one-way quantum computer. The extra power of the one-way model, comparing with the quantum circuit model, comes from its classical-quantum hybrid nature. We show that this extra power is reduced to the capability to perform unbounded classical parity gates in constant depth.},

We present both in-place and out-of-place versions, as well as versions that add modulo 2\^{}n and modulo 2\^{}n - 1.   Previously, the linear-depth ripple-carry addition circuit has been the method of choice. Our work reduces the cost of addition dramatically with only a slight increase in the number of required qubits.

@article{Choi2010,
	Abstract = {In this work, we propose an adder for the 2D NTC architecture, designed to match the architectural constraints of many quantum computing technologies. The chosen architecture allows the layout of logical qubits in two dimensions and the concurrent execution of one- and two-qubit gates with nearest-neighbor interaction only. The proposed adder works in three phases. In the first phase, the first column generates the summation output and the other columns do the carry-lookahead operations. In the second phase, these intermediate values are propagated from column to column, preparing for computation of the final carry for each register position. In the last phase, each column, except the first one, generates the summation output using this column-level carry. The depth and the number of qubits of the proposed adder are \$\backslash Theta(\backslash sqrt\{n\})\$ and O(n), respectively. The proposed adder executes faster than the adders designed for the 1D NTC architecture when the length of the input registers \$n\$ is larger than 58.},

@article{Fowler2004,
	Abstract = {Shor's algorithm, which given appropriate hardware can factorise an integer \$N\$ in a time polynomial in its binary length \$L\$, has arguable spurred the race to build a practical quantum computer. Several different quantum circuits implementing Shor's algorithm have been designed, but each tacitly assumes that arbitrary pairs of qubits within the computer can be interacted. While some quantum computer architectures possess this property, many promising proposals are best suited to realising a single line of qubits with nearest neighbour interactions only. In light of this, we present a circuit implementing Shor's factorisation algorithm designed for such a linear nearest neighbour architecture. Despite the interaction restrictions, the circuit requires just \$2L+4\$ qubits and to first order requires \$8L\^{}\{4\}\$ gates arranged in a circuit of depth \$32L\^{}\{3\}\$ -- identical to first order to that possible using an architecture that can interact arbitrary pairs of qubits.},

The exact size is 7n-6, which is smaller than that of any other quantum circuit ever constructed for addition with no ancillary qubits. Using the circuit, we then propose a method for constructing an O(d(n))-depth O(n)-size quantum circuit for addition with O(n/d(n)) ancillary qubits for any d(n)=$\backslash$Omega(log n). If we are allowed to use unbounded fan-out gates with length O(n\^{}c) for an arbitrary small positive constant c, we can modify the method and construct an O(e(n))-depth O(n)-size circuit with o(n) ancillary qubits for any e(n)=$\backslash$Omega(log* n). In particular, these methods yield efficient circuits with depth O(log n) and with depth O(log* n), respectively. We apply our circuits to constructing efficient quantum circuits for Shor's discrete logarithm algorithm.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the impact on modular exponentiation of architectural features and possible concurrent gate execution. Various arithmetic algorithms are evaluated for execution time, potential concurrency, and space tradeoffs. We find that, to exponentiate an n-bit number, for storage space 100n (twenty times the minimum 5n), we can execute modular exponentiation two hundred to seven hundred times faster than optimized versions of the basic algorithms, depending on architecture, for n=128. Addition on a neighbor-only architecture is limited to O(n) time when non-neighbor architectures can reach O(log n), demonstrating that physical characteristics of a computing device have an important impact on both real-world running time and asymptotic behavior. Our results will help guide experimental implementations of quantum algorithms and devices.},

	Abstract = {Universal quantum computation (UQC) using Majorana fermions on a 2D topological superconducting (TS) medium remains an outstanding open problem. This is because the quantum gate set that can be generated by braiding of the Majorana fermions does not include $\backslash$emph\{any\} two-qubit gate and also the single-qubit \$\backslash pi/8\$ phase gate. In principle, it is possible to create these crucial extra gates using quantum interference of Majorana fermion currents. However, it is not clear if the motion of the various order parameter defects (vortices, domain walls, $\backslash$emph\{etc.\}), to which the Majorana fermions are bound in a TS medium, can be quantum coherent. We show that these obstacles can be overcome using a semiconductor quantum wire network in the vicinity of an \$s\$-wave superconductor, by constructing topologically protected two-qubit gates and any arbitrary single-qubit phase gate in a topologically unprotected manner, which can be error corrected using magic state distillation. Thus our strategy, using a judicious combination of topologically protected and unprotected gate operations, realizes UQC on a quantum wire network with a remarkably high error threshold of \$0.14\$ as compared to \$10\^{}\{-3\}\$ to \$10\^{}\{-4\}\$ in ordinary unprotected quantum computation.},

In particular, we provide for the first time a full characterization of patterns with flow of arbitrary depth, based on the notion of influencing paths and a simple rewriting system on the angles of the measurement. Our method leads to insightful knowledge for constructing parallel circuits and as applications, we demonstrate several constant and logarithmic depth circuits.

However, on a realistic scalable quantum computer, these logical operations would have to be compiled down to a small set of elementary gates which then have to be performed in a fault-tolerant manner. We present an algorithm for computing depth-optimal decompositions of logical operations, leveraging a \{$\backslash$it meet-in-the-middle\} technique to provide a significant speed-up over simple brute force algorithms. As an illustration of our method, we present a decomposition of the Toffoli gate over the set of Clifford and \$T\$-gates. This elementary gate set arises, e.g., from fault-tolerant computing over the Steane code or the surface code. Our decomposition achieves a total \$T\$-depth of 3, thereby providing a 40\% reduction over the previously best known decomposition for the Toffoli gate.},

As in classical models of computation, quantum error correction techniques3, 4 enable rectification of small imperfections in gate operations, thus enabling perfect computation in the presence of noise. For fault-tolerant computation5, it is believed that error thresholds ranging between 10-

The second contribution is a quantum circuit for the Toffoli gate which can detect a single \$\backslash sigma\^{}z\$ error occurring with probability \$p\$ in any one of eight \$T\$ gates required to produce the Toffoli. By post-selecting circuits that did not detect an error, the posterior error probability is suppressed to lowest order from \$4p\$ (or \$7p\$, without the first contribution) to \$28p\^{}2\$ for this enhanced construction.

    abstract = {We give new bounds on the circuit complexity of the quantum Fourier transform (QFT). We give an upper bound of O(log n + log log (1/epsilon)) on the circuit depth for computing an approximation of the QFT with respect to the modulus 2\^{}n with error bounded by epsilon. Thus, even for exponentially small error, our circuits have depth O(log n). The best previous depth bound was O(n), even for approximations with constant error. Moreover, our circuits have size O(n log (n/epsilon)). We also give an upper bound of O(n (log n)\^{}2 log log n) on the circuit size of the exact QFT modulo 2\^{}n, for which the best previous bound was O(n\^{}2).   As an application of the above depth bound, we show that Shor's factoring algorithm may be based on quantum circuits with depth only O(log n) and polynomial-size, in combination with classical polynomial-time pre- and post-processing. In the language of computational complexity, this implies that factoring is in the complexity class ZPP\^{}BQNC, where BQNC is the class of problems computable with bounded-error probability by quantum circuits with poly-logarithmic depth and polynomial size.   Finally, we prove an Omega(log n) lower bound on the depth complexity of approximations of the QFT with constant error. This implies that the above upper bound is asymptotically optimal (for a reasonable range of values of epsilon).},

abstract = {For certain quantum architectures and algorithms, most of the required resources are consumed during the distillation of one-qubit magic-states for use in performing Toffoli gates. I show that the overhead for magic-state distillation can be reduced by merging distillation with the implementation of Toffoli gates. The resulting routine distills 8 one-qubit magic-states directly to a Toffoli state, which can be used without further magic to perform a Toffoli gate.},

@article{Monroe2012,
abstract = {The practical construction of scalable quantum computer hardware capable of executing non-trivial quantum algorithms will require the juxtaposition of different types of quantum systems. We propose a modular quantum computer architecture with a hierarchy of interactions that can scale to very large numbers of qubits. Local entangling quantum gates between qubit memories within a single register are accomplished using natural interactions between the qubits, and entanglement between separate registers is completed via a probabilistic photonic interface between qubits in different registers, even over large distances. This architecture compares to the "multicore" classical information processor, and is suitable for the implementation of complex quantum circuits utilizing the flexible connectivity provided by a reconfigurable photonic interconnect network. We further show that this architecture can be made fault-tolerant, a prerequisite for scalability. All of the rudiments of this architecture have been demonstrated in small-scale trapped ion systems, and we speculate on the technological hurdles ahead in order to realize such a system.},

Using a combination of existing and new ideas, we argue that measurement times as long as even 1,000 gate times or more have a very minimal effect on the quantum accuracy threshold. This shows that slow measurement, which appears to be unavoidable in many implementations of quantum computing, poses no essential obstacle to scalability.},

abstract = {The tradeoffs between the depth (i.e., the time for parallel computation) and the size (i.e., the number of threshold gates) in neural networks are studied. The authors focus the study on the neural computations of symmetric Boolean functions and some arithmetic functions. It is shown that a significant reduction in the size is possible for symmetric functions and some arithmetic functions, at the expense of a small constant increase in depth. In the process, several neural networks which have the minimum size among all the known constructions have been developed. Results on implementing symmetric functions can be used to improve results about arbitrary Boolean functions. In particular, it is shown that any Boolean function can be computed in a depth-3 neural network with O(2n 2) threshold gates; it is also proven that at least $\Omega$(2 n 3) threshold gates are required},

abstract = {All Boolean variables here range over the two-element set \$\backslash\{ - 1,1 \backslash\}\$. Given n Boolean variables \$x\_1 , \backslash ldots ,x\_n \$, a nonmonotone MAJORITY gate (in the variables \$x\_i \$) is a Boolean function whose value is the sign of \$\backslash Sigma \_\{i = 1\}\^{}n \backslash varepsilon \_i x\_i \$, where each \$ \backslash varepsilon \_i \$ is either 1 or \$ - 1\$. The COMPARISON function is the Boolean function of two n-bits integers X and Y whose value is \$ - 1\$ if and only if \$X\backslash geqq Y\$. An explicit sparse polynomial whose sign computes this function is constructed. Similar polynomials are constructed for computing all the bits of the summation of the two numbers X and Y. This supplies explicit constructions of depth-2 polynomial-size circuits computing these functions, which use only nonmonotone MAJORITY gates. These constructions are optimal in terms of the depth and can be used to obtain the best-known explicit constructions of MAJORITY circuits for other functions like the product of two n-bit numbers and the maximum of nn-bit numbers.

@article{Jones2012,
abstract = {Quantum computers can in principle simulate quantum physics exponentially faster than their classical counterparts, but some technical hurdles remain. Here we consider methods to make proposed chemical simulation algorithms computationally fast on fault-tolerant quantum computers in the circuit model. Fault tolerance constrains the choice of available gates, so that arbitrary gates required for a simulation algorithm must be constructed from sequences of fundamental operations. We examine techniques for constructing arbitrary gates which perform substantially faster than circuits based on the conventional Solovay-Kitaev algorithm [C.M. Dawson and M.A. Nielsen, $\backslash$emph\{Quantum Inf. Comput.\}, $\backslash$textbf\{6\}:81, 2006]. For a given approximation error \$\backslash epsilon\$, arbitrary single-qubit gates can be produced fault-tolerantly and using a limited set of gates in time which is \$O(\backslash log \backslash epsilon)\$ or \$O(\backslash log \backslash log \backslash epsilon)\$; with sufficient parallel preparation of ancillas, constant average depth is possible using a method we call programmable ancilla rotations. Moreover, we construct and analyze efficient implementations of first- and second-quantized simulation algorithms using the fault-tolerant arbitrary gates and other techniques, such as implementing various subroutines in constant time. A specific example we analyze is the ground-state energy calculation for Lithium hydride.},
