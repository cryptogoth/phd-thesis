	Abstract = {We show that the depth of quantum circuits in a realistic architecture where a classical controller determines which local interactions to apply on the (k)D grid ($\backslash$bbZ\^{}k) where (k $\backslash$geq 2) is the same (up to a constant factor) as in the standard model where arbitrary interactions are allowed. This allows minimum-depth circuits for the nearest-neighbor architecture to be obtained from minimum-depth circuits in the standard abstract model. Our work therefore justifies the standard assumption that quantum algorithms can perform interactions between arbitrary pairs of qubits. In particular, our results imply that Shor's algorithm, controlled operations and fan-outs can be implemented in constant depth, polynomial size and polynomial width in this architecture.   We also present optimal non-adaptive quantum circuits for controlled operations and fan-outs on a (k)D grid. These circuits have depth ($\backslash$Theta($\backslash$sqrt[k]\{n\})), size ($\backslash$Theta(n)) and width ($\backslash$Theta(n)). Our lower bound is for a general class of operations which includes controlled operations and fan-outs as special cases.},

Classically, we need logarithmic depth even if we can use unbounded fan-in gates. If we allow arbitrary one-qubit gates instead of a fixed basis, then these circuits can also be made exact in log-star depth. Sorting, arithmetical operations, phase estimation, and the quantum Fourier transform with arbitrary moduli can also be approximated in constant depth.},

@article{Bonderson2010,
	Abstract = {The advancement of information processing into the realm of quantum mechanics promises a transcendence in computational power that will enable problems to be solved which are completely beyond the known abilities of any "classical" computer, including any potential non-quantum technologies the future may bring. However, the fragility of quantum states poses a challenging obstacle for realization of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The topological approach to quantum computation proposes to surmount this obstacle by using special physical systems -- non-Abelian topologically ordered phases of matter -- that would provide intrinsic fault-tolerance at the hardware level. The so-called "Ising-type" non-Abelian topological order is likely to be physically realized in a number of systems, but it can only provide a universal gate set (a requisite for quantum computation) if one has the ability to perform certain dynamical topology-changing operations on the system. Until now, practical methods of implementing these operations were unknown. Here we show how the necessary operations can be physically implemented for Ising-type systems realized in the recently proposed superconductor-semiconductor and superconductor-topological insulator heterostructures. Furthermore, we specify routines employing these methods to generate a computationally universal gate set. We are consequently able to provide a schematic blueprint for a fully topologically-protected Ising based quantum computer using currently available materials and techniques. This may serve as a starting point for attempts to construct a fault-tolerant quantum computer, which will have applications to cryptanalysis, drug design, efficient simulation of quantum many-body systems, solution of large systems of linear equations, searching large databases, engineering future quantum computers, and -- most importantly -- those applications which no one in our classical era has the prescience to foresee.},

We expand on the first report of the experiment [1], including a detailed discussion of how the transport potentials were calculated. Two main mechanisms that caused motional excitation during transport are explained, along with the methods used to mitigate such excitation. We reduced the motional excitation below the results in Ref. [1] by a factor of approximately 50. The effect of a mu-metal shield on qubit coherence is also reported. Finally, we examined a method for exchanging energy between multiple motional modes on the few-quanta level, which could be useful for cooling motional modes without directly accessing the modes with lasers. These results establish how trapped ions can be transported in a large-scale quantum processor with high fidelity.},

	Abstract = {We prove that one-way quantum computations have the same computational power as quantum circuits with unbounded fan-out. It demonstrates that the one-way model is not only one of the most promising models of physical realisation, but also a very powerful model of quantum computation. It confirms and completes previous results which have pointed out, for some specific problems, a depth separation between the one-way model and the quantum circuit model. Since one-way model has the same computational power as unbounded quantum fan-out circuits, the quantum Fourier transform can be approximated in constant depth in the one-way model, and thus the factorisation can be done by a polytime probabilistic classical algorithm which has access to a constant-depth one-way quantum computer. The extra power of the one-way model, comparing with the quantum circuit model, comes from its classical-quantum hybrid nature. We show that this extra power is reduced to the capability to perform unbounded classical parity gates in constant depth.},

We present both in-place and out-of-place versions, as well as versions that add modulo 2\^{}n and modulo 2\^{}n - 1.   Previously, the linear-depth ripple-carry addition circuit has been the method of choice. Our work reduces the cost of addition dramatically with only a slight increase in the number of required qubits.

@article{Choi2010,
	Abstract = {In this work, we propose an adder for the 2D NTC architecture, designed to match the architectural constraints of many quantum computing technologies. The chosen architecture allows the layout of logical qubits in two dimensions and the concurrent execution of one- and two-qubit gates with nearest-neighbor interaction only. The proposed adder works in three phases. In the first phase, the first column generates the summation output and the other columns do the carry-lookahead operations. In the second phase, these intermediate values are propagated from column to column, preparing for computation of the final carry for each register position. In the last phase, each column, except the first one, generates the summation output using this column-level carry. The depth and the number of qubits of the proposed adder are \$\backslash Theta(\backslash sqrt\{n\})\$ and O(n), respectively. The proposed adder executes faster than the adders designed for the 1D NTC architecture when the length of the input registers \$n\$ is larger than 58.},

@article{Fowler2004,
	Abstract = {Shor's algorithm, which given appropriate hardware can factorise an integer \$N\$ in a time polynomial in its binary length \$L\$, has arguable spurred the race to build a practical quantum computer. Several different quantum circuits implementing Shor's algorithm have been designed, but each tacitly assumes that arbitrary pairs of qubits within the computer can be interacted. While some quantum computer architectures possess this property, many promising proposals are best suited to realising a single line of qubits with nearest neighbour interactions only. In light of this, we present a circuit implementing Shor's factorisation algorithm designed for such a linear nearest neighbour architecture. Despite the interaction restrictions, the circuit requires just \$2L+4\$ qubits and to first order requires \$8L\^{}\{4\}\$ gates arranged in a circuit of depth \$32L\^{}\{3\}\$ -- identical to first order to that possible using an architecture that can interact arbitrary pairs of qubits.},

The exact size is 7n-6, which is smaller than that of any other quantum circuit ever constructed for addition with no ancillary qubits. Using the circuit, we then propose a method for constructing an O(d(n))-depth O(n)-size quantum circuit for addition with O(n/d(n)) ancillary qubits for any d(n)=$\backslash$Omega(log n). If we are allowed to use unbounded fan-out gates with length O(n\^{}c) for an arbitrary small positive constant c, we can modify the method and construct an O(e(n))-depth O(n)-size circuit with o(n) ancillary qubits for any e(n)=$\backslash$Omega(log* n). In particular, these methods yield efficient circuits with depth O(log n) and with depth O(log* n), respectively. We apply our circuits to constructing efficient quantum circuits for Shor's discrete logarithm algorithm.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the impact on modular exponentiation of architectural features and possible concurrent gate execution. Various arithmetic algorithms are evaluated for execution time, potential concurrency, and space tradeoffs. We find that, to exponentiate an n-bit number, for storage space 100n (twenty times the minimum 5n), we can execute modular exponentiation two hundred to seven hundred times faster than optimized versions of the basic algorithms, depending on architecture, for n=128. Addition on a neighbor-only architecture is limited to O(n) time when non-neighbor architectures can reach O(log n), demonstrating that physical characteristics of a computing device have an important impact on both real-world running time and asymptotic behavior. Our results will help guide experimental implementations of quantum algorithms and devices.},

	Abstract = {Universal quantum computation (UQC) using Majorana fermions on a 2D topological superconducting (TS) medium remains an outstanding open problem. This is because the quantum gate set that can be generated by braiding of the Majorana fermions does not include $\backslash$emph\{any\} two-qubit gate and also the single-qubit \$\backslash pi/8\$ phase gate. In principle, it is possible to create these crucial extra gates using quantum interference of Majorana fermion currents. However, it is not clear if the motion of the various order parameter defects (vortices, domain walls, $\backslash$emph\{etc.\}), to which the Majorana fermions are bound in a TS medium, can be quantum coherent. We show that these obstacles can be overcome using a semiconductor quantum wire network in the vicinity of an \$s\$-wave superconductor, by constructing topologically protected two-qubit gates and any arbitrary single-qubit phase gate in a topologically unprotected manner, which can be error corrected using magic state distillation. Thus our strategy, using a judicious combination of topologically protected and unprotected gate operations, realizes UQC on a quantum wire network with a remarkably high error threshold of \$0.14\$ as compared to \$10\^{}\{-3\}\$ to \$10\^{}\{-4\}\$ in ordinary unprotected quantum computation.},

In particular, we provide for the first time a full characterization of patterns with flow of arbitrary depth, based on the notion of influencing paths and a simple rewriting system on the angles of the measurement. Our method leads to insightful knowledge for constructing parallel circuits and as applications, we demonstrate several constant and logarithmic depth circuits.

However, on a realistic scalable quantum computer, these logical operations would have to be compiled down to a small set of elementary gates which then have to be performed in a fault-tolerant manner. We present an algorithm for computing depth-optimal decompositions of logical operations, leveraging a \{$\backslash$it meet-in-the-middle\} technique to provide a significant speed-up over simple brute force algorithms. As an illustration of our method, we present a decomposition of the Toffoli gate over the set of Clifford and \$T\$-gates. This elementary gate set arises, e.g., from fault-tolerant computing over the Steane code or the surface code. Our decomposition achieves a total \$T\$-depth of 3, thereby providing a 40\% reduction over the previously best known decomposition for the Toffoli gate.},

For the implementation of arbitrary operations, a quantum computer requires a universal set of quantum logic gates. As in classical models of computation, quantum error correction techniques3, 4 enable rectification of small imperfections in gate operations, thus enabling perfect computation in the presence of noise. For fault-tolerant computation5, it is believed that error thresholds ranging between 10-

The second contribution is a quantum circuit for the Toffoli gate which can detect a single \$\backslash sigma\^{}z\$ error occurring with probability \$p\$ in any one of eight \$T\$ gates required to produce the Toffoli. By post-selecting circuits that did not detect an error, the posterior error probability is suppressed to lowest order from \$4p\$ (or \$7p\$, without the first contribution) to \$28p\^{}2\$ for this enhanced construction.

    abstract = {We give new bounds on the circuit complexity of the quantum Fourier transform (QFT). We give an upper bound of O(log n + log log (1/epsilon)) on the circuit depth for computing an approximation of the QFT with respect to the modulus 2\^{}n with error bounded by epsilon. Thus, even for exponentially small error, our circuits have depth O(log n). The best previous depth bound was O(n), even for approximations with constant error. Moreover, our circuits have size O(n log (n/epsilon)). We also give an upper bound of O(n (log n)\^{}2 log log n) on the circuit size of the exact QFT modulo 2\^{}n, for which the best previous bound was O(n\^{}2).   As an application of the above depth bound, we show that Shor's factoring algorithm may be based on quantum circuits with depth only O(log n) and polynomial-size, in combination with classical polynomial-time pre- and post-processing. In the language of computational complexity, this implies that factoring is in the complexity class ZPP\^{}BQNC, where BQNC is the class of problems computable with bounded-error probability by quantum circuits with poly-logarithmic depth and polynomial size.   Finally, we prove an Omega(log n) lower bound on the depth complexity of approximations of the QFT with constant error. This implies that the above upper bound is asymptotically optimal (for a reasonable range of values of epsilon).},

We propose a modular quantum computer architecture with a hierarchy of interactions that can scale to very large numbers of qubits. Local entangling quantum gates between qubit memories within a single register are accomplished using natural interactions between the qubits, and entanglement between separate registers is completed via a probabilistic photonic interface between qubits in different registers, even over large distances. This architecture compares to the "multicore" classical information processor, and is suitable for the implementation of complex quantum circuits utilizing the flexible connectivity provided by a reconfigurable photonic interconnect network. We further show that this architecture can be made fault-tolerant, a prerequisite for scalability. All of the rudiments of this architecture have been demonstrated in small-scale trapped ion systems, and we speculate on the technological hurdles ahead in order to realize such a system.},

Here we consider methods to make proposed chemical simulation algorithms computationally fast on fault-tolerant quantum computers in the circuit model. Fault tolerance constrains the choice of available gates, so that arbitrary gates required for a simulation algorithm must be constructed from sequences of fundamental operations. We examine techniques for constructing arbitrary gates which perform substantially faster than circuits based on the conventional Solovay-Kitaev algorithm [C.M. Dawson and M.A. Nielsen, $\backslash$emph\{Quantum Inf. Comput.\}, $\backslash$textbf\{6\}:81, 2006]. For a given approximation error \$\backslash epsilon\$, arbitrary single-qubit gates can be produced fault-tolerantly and using a limited set of gates in time which is \$O(\backslash log \backslash epsilon)\$ or \$O(\backslash log \backslash log \backslash epsilon)\$; with sufficient parallel preparation of ancillas, constant average depth is possible using a method we call programmable ancilla rotations. Moreover, we construct and analyze efficient implementations of first- and second-quantized simulation algorithms using the fault-tolerant arbitrary gates and other techniques, such as implementing various subroutines in constant time. A specific example we analyze is the ground-state energy calculation for Lithium hydride.},

The weights are arbitrary integers; actually, they can be very big integers—exponential in the number of input variables. However, in practice, it is very difficult to implement big weights. So the natural question that may be asked is whether there is an efficient way to simulate a network of LTEs with big weights by a network of LTEs with small weights. The following results are proved: (1) every LTE with big weights can be simulated by a depth-3, polynomial size network of LTEs with small weights; and (2) every depth-d, polynomial size network of LTEs with big weights can be simulated by a depth-\$( 2d + 1 )\$, polynomial size network of LTEs with small weights. To prove these results, tools from harmonic analysis of Boolean functions are used. The technique is quite general; it provides insights to some other problems. For e...},

In addition to meeting the known logarithmic lower bounds on the number of gates required to approximate a unitary by a quantum circuit, we give computational evidence that a very close to the best, or the best existing approximation for unitaries of the type diag\{1, exp(i*phi)\} were indeed found. In particular, the quality of our approximation is determined by the ability of the PARI software package to find the solution of a certain type of Diophantine equation, and the choice of internal parameter Delta determining the size of a computer search. We have furthermore structured our search to guarantee that our near-optimal approximations can be found for reasonable error parameters---currently, down to 10\^{}\{-17\}, allowing to execute very long quantum circuits. We discuss how to improve our implementation further to handle even smaller errors (by a few orders of magnitude) that would enable the high-precision synthesis of even larger quantum algorithms.},

The algorithm for computing our approximating circuit requires an average of O(log\^{}2(1/\{$\backslash$epsilon\})log log(1/\{$\backslash$epsilon\})) operations. We prove that the number of gates in our circuit saturates the lower bound on the number of gates required in the scenario when a constant number of ancillae are supplied, and as such, our circuits are asymptotically optimal.

Although it is well known that certain gates on two-level quantum systems (qubits), such as the controlled-not (CNOT), are universal when assisted by arbitrary one-qubit gates, it has only recently become clear precisely what class of two-qubit gates is universal in this sense. Here we present an elementary proof that any entangling two-qubit gate is universal for quantum computation, when assisted by one-qubit gates. A proof of this important result for systems of arbitrary finite dimension has been provided by J. L. and R. Brylinski [arXiv:quant-ph/0108062, 2001]; however, their proof relies upon a long argument using advanced mathematics. In contrast, our proof provides a simple constructive procedure which is close to optimal and experimentally practical [C. M. Dawson and A.

In order to perform quantum algorithms, physicists would like to design arbitrary gates to apply to quantum bits. However, the physical limitations of the quantum computing device restrict the set of gates that physicists are able to apply. Thus, they must compose a sequence of gates from the permitted gate set, which approximates the gate they wish to apply - a process called quantum compiling. Austin Fowler proposes a method that finds optimal gate sequences in exponential time, but which is tractable for common problems. In this paper, I present several optimizations to this algorithm. While my optimizations do not improve its overall exponential behavior, they improve its empirical performance by one to two orders of magnitude.},

In addition, we allow the creation of a one-qubit ancilla in a mixed state \$\backslash rho\$, which should be regarded as a parameter of the model. Our goal is to determine for which \$\backslash rho\$ universal quantum computation (UQC) can be efficiently simulated. To answer this question, we construct purification protocols that consume several copies of \$\backslash rho\$ and produce a single output qubit with higher polarization. The protocols allow one to increase the polarization only along certain ``magic'' directions. If the polarization of \$\backslash rho\$ along a magic direction exceeds a threshold value (about 65\%), the purification asymptotically yields a pure state, which we call a magic state. We show that the Clifford group operations combined with magic states preparation are sufficient for UQC. The connection of our results with the Gottesman-Knill theorem is discussed.},

For a given single-qubit rotation, our protocol significantly lowers the length of the approximating sequence and the number of required resource states (ancillary qubits). In addition, our protocol is robust to noise in the resource states.},

Although the overhead required to distill high-fidelity copies of this magic state is high, the subsequent quantum compiling overhead to realize \$Z\$ rotations in a $\backslash$textsc\{risc\} architecture can be much greater.

abstract = {One of the main goals in quantum circuit optimisation is to reduce the number of ancillary qubits and the depth of computation, to obtain robust computation. However, most of known techniques, based on local rewriting rules, for parallelising quantum circuits will require the addition of ancilla qubits, leading to an undesired space-time tradeoff. Recently several novel approaches based on measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) techniques attempted to resolve this problem. The key element is to explore the global structure of a given circuit, defined via translation into a corresponding MBQC pattern. It is known that the parallel power of MBQC is superior to the quantum circuit model, and hence in these approaches one could apply the MBQC depth optimisation techniques to achieve a lower depth. However, currently, once the obtained parallel pattern is translated back to a quantum circuit, one should either increase the depth or add ancilla qubits. In this paper we characterise those computations where both optimisation could be achieved together. In doing so we present a new connection between two MBQC depth optimisation procedures, known as the maximally delayed generalised flow and signal shifting. This structural link will allow us to apply an MBQC qubit optimisation procedure known as compactification to a large class of pattern including all those obtained from any arbitrary quantum circuit. We also present a more efficient algorithm (compared to the existing one) for finding the maximally delayed generalised flow for graph states with flow.},

abstract = {Given any irreversible program with running time T and space complexity S, and given any \$\backslash varepsilon > 0\$, Bennett shows how to construct an equivalent reversible program with running time \$O(T\^{}\{1+\backslash varepsilon \})\$ and space complexity \$O(S \backslash ln T)\$. Although these loose upper bounds are formally correct, they are misleading due to a hidden constant factor in the space bound. It is shown that this constant factor is approximately \$\backslash varepsilon 2\^{}\{1 / \backslash varepsilon\}\$, which diverges exponentially as \$\backslash varepsilon\$ approaches 0. Bennett’s analysis is simplified using recurrence equations and it is proven that the reversible program actually runs in time \$\backslash Theta (\{\{T\^{}\{1 + \backslash varepsilon\}\} / \{S\^{}\{\backslash varepsilon\}\}\})\$ and space \$\backslash Theta (S(1+\backslash ln (\{T / S\})))\$.Bennett claims that for any \$\backslash varepsilon > 0\$, the reversible program can be made to run in time \$O(T)\$ and space \$O(ST\^{}\{\backslash varepsilon \})\$. This claim is corrected and tightened as follows: whenever \$T \backslash geqq 2S\$ and for any \$\backslash varepsilon \backslash geqq \{1 / \{(0.58 \backslash lg (\{T / S\}))\}\}\$,...},

abstract = {We provide algorithms for efficiently addressing quantum memory in parallel. These imply that the standard circuit model can be simulated with low overhead by the more realistic model of a distributed quantum computer. As a result, the circuit model can be used by algorithm designers without worrying whether the underlying architecture supports the connectivity of the circuit. In addition, we apply our results to existing memory intensive quantum algorithms. We present a parallel quantum search algorithm and improve the time-space trade-off for the Element Distinctness and Collision problems.},

@article{Berry2005,
	Abstract = {We present an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating the evolution of a sparse Hamiltonian H for a given time t in terms of a procedure for computing the matrix entries of H. In particular, when H acts on n qubits, has at most a constant number of nonzero entries in each row/column, and |H| is bounded by a constant, we may select any positive integer \$k\$ such that the simulation requires O(($\backslash$log\^{}*n)t\^{}\{1+1/2k\}) accesses to matrix entries of H. We show that the temporal scaling cannot be significantly improved beyond this, because sublinear time scaling is not possible.},

@article{Aharonov2003,
	Abstract = {The design of new quantum algorithms has proven to be an extremely difficult task. This paper considers a different approach to the problem, by studying the problem of 'quantum state generation'. This approach provides intriguing links between many different areas: quantum computation, adiabatic evolution, analysis of spectral gaps and groundstates of Hamiltonians, rapidly mixing Markov chains, the complexity class statistical zero knowledge, quantum random walks, and more. We first show that many natural candidates for quantum algorithms can be cast as a state generation problem. We define a paradigm for state generation, called 'adiabatic state generation' and develop tools for adiabatic state generation which include methods for implementing very general Hamiltonians and ways to guarantee non negligible spectral gaps. We use our tools to prove that adiabatic state generation is equivalent to state generation in the standard quantum computing model, and finally we show how to apply our techniques to generate interesting superpositions related to Markov chains.},

@article{Li1998,
abstract = {Reversible simulation of irreversible algorithms is analyzed in the stylized form of a `reversible' pebble game. While such simulations incur little overhead in additional computation time, they use a large amount of additional memory space during the computation. The reacheable reversible simulation instantaneous descriptions (pebble configurations) are characterized completely. As a corollary we obtain the reversible simulation by Bennett and that among all simulations that can be modelled by the pebble game, Bennett's simulation is optimal in that it uses the least auxiliary space for the greatest number of simulated steps. One can reduce the auxiliary storage overhead incurred by the reversible simulation at the cost of allowing limited erasing leading to an irreversibility-space tradeoff. We show that in this resource-bounded setting the limited erasing needs to be performed at precise instants during the simulation. We show that the reversible simulation can be modified so that it is applicable also when the simulated computation time is unknown.},

@article{VanMeter2008,
abstract = {We evaluate the performance of quantum arithmetic algorithms run on a distributed quantum computer (a quantum multicomputer). We vary the node capacity and I/O capabilities, and the network topology. The tradeoff of choosing between gates executed remotely, through ``teleported gates'' on entangled pairs of qubits (telegate), versus exchanging the relevant qubits via quantum teleportation, then executing the algorithm using local gates (teledata), is examined. We show that the teledata approach performs better, and that carry-ripple adders perform well when the teleportation block is decomposed so that the key quantum operations can be parallelized. A node size of only a few logical qubits performs adequately provided that the nodes have two transceiver qubits. A linear network topology performs acceptably for a broad range of system sizes and performance parameters. We therefore recommend pursuing small, high-I/O bandwidth nodes and a simple network. Such a machine will run Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers efficiently.},

abstract = {We address the challenge of designing a quantum computer architecture with a layered framework that is modular and facilitates fault-tolerance. The framework is flexible and could be used for analysis and comparison of differing quantum computer designs. Using this framework, we develop a complete, layered architecture for quantum computing with optically controlled quantum dots, showing how a myriad of technologies must operate synchronously to achieve fault-tolerance. Our design deliberately takes advantage of the large possibilities for integration afforded by semiconductor fabrication. Quantum information is stored in the electron spin states of a charged quantum dot controlled by ultrafast optical pulses. Optical control makes this system very fast, scalable to large problem sizes, and extensible to quantum communication or distributed architectures. The design of this quantum computer centers on error correction in the form of a topological surface code, which requires only local and nearest-neighbor gates. We analyze several important issues of the surface code that are relevant to an architecture, such as resource accounting and the use of Pauli frames. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of this system and find that Shor's factoring algorithm for a 2048-bit number can be executed in approximately one week.},
