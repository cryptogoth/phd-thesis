		4. modules

II. Review of Chapter 1
	A. main results, each module of factoring, leading up to polylog hybrid factoring

III. Review of Chapter 2
	A. main results, each module of quantum majority gates, leading up to sublog hybrid factoring
	B. conjecture of sublog factoring without using quantum majority gates

IV. Review of Chapter 3
	A. main result: quantum fourier state generation with early measurement and reduced resources
	B. based on result in the appendix

V. Review of Chapter 4
	A. main results: connection of circuit coherence for layered quantum circuits with pebble game space
	B. main result: configurable depth factoring from Chapter 1, in two ways
	B. conjecture: circuit coherence for factoring is O(n^3\log n \log\log n) and is asymptotically separated from depth*width

VI. Future directions
	A. Exploit locality in hamiltonian simulation, apply general principles to another algorithm
