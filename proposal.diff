-\item[February 22]
-I begin writing, at least on non-controversial parts of proposal, until
-we come to a consensus on the whole proposal. This 6 week period is

+\item[March 30]
+Finish first part of Chapter 1, on 2D factoring in polylogarithmic
+depth.
 
-\item[April 5]
-I finish writing and remaining research and send a penultimate dissertation
-draft to the reading committee. Beginning of two week reading period.
+\item[April 30]
+Finish remaining part of Chapter 1, on 2D factoring in sublogarithmic
+depth.
 
-\item[April 19]
-End of two week reading period. Reading committee gives me feedback and
-decides whether thesis is ready to be defended. I schedule my final exam with
-the graduate school (tentatively set for May 3rd), make requested changes to dissertation,
-and prepare my talk.
+\item[May 7]
+Finish Chapter 2 on quantum compiling. Submit to reading committee.
