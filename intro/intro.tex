\label{chap:intro}

% I. Quantum computing and perspectives
The combination of existing scientific disciplines provides fertile ground
for the development of entirely new scientific discoveries. Computer science
and quantum physics are now coming together in this way to give birth to
quantum computing. Computer science and quantum physics originated
as contemporaries in the early part of the 20th century, culminating in
technology that decisively ended World War II. They have remained
largely independent until recently, but the common thread connecting them
has always existed.

From the perspective of computer science, engineering is problem-driven.
We humans wish to solve a problem, like calculating ballistic weapon
trajectories, and we work backwards to electromechanical relays or punched
cards. To calculate,
we need to perform fast
arithmetic on stored numbers, for which we need to design devices in a
certain configuration, for which we need certain materials from nature.
At heart, it is the study of structured problem-solving which historically
has a strong
mechanical bias. This perspective asks the questions: what do we want to do,
and how can we
do it? It is like a child going into a LEGO store with a pre-existing plan:
the child only buys the bricks needed, or orders custom bricks.
It is an efficient plan for brick procurement, but not
necessarily creative in exploring the space of all possible LEGO designs.

From the perspective of quantum physics, engineering is phenomena-based.
We humans wish to describe reality and observe nature. We discover objects
and effects in nature, and afterwards we may
then discover that they
can be useful in performing some useful task. An example is
the discovery of quantum tunnelling and its subsequent use to build a
field-effect transistor (FET) for digital electronics. This perspective asks the
questions: what is available to us, and what could we do it? It is like a child
going into a LEGO store with no pre-conceived plan, investigating all the
parts, dreaming up ways to use them, or even delving into custom brick design
as a more fundamental level. This will generate completely new
designs and models, but it is much slower than brick-shopping.

These perspectives are intertwined and serve complementary purposes,
and we often alternate
between the two of them. In our transistor example, we probably would not
have thought to build a FET if we had not already needed fast electrical
switching, for which vacuum tubes were proving inadequate. Moreover, we can
go beyond using quantum physics to simulate a classical device. There is
a remarkable example
of a new class of algorithms designed using the building blocks of
quantum physics. The first instance of such an algorithm solves the problem
of factoring.

% II. Factoring
The problem of factorization, or factoring,
is simple to state and difficult to solve.
Given an integer $m$, return the integers $\{p_1, \ldots, p_k\}$ whose
product of their powers is $m$: $m = p_1^{\alpha_1}\cdots p_k^{\alpha_k}$.
It is a beautiful theoretical problem posed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1801;
although he is considered by many to be one of history's greatest mathematicians,
he was still unable to factor arbitrarily large numbers. 
His feelings on the subject can be paraphrased as follows:
Factoring was the most important problem in the theory of
numbers, itself the crown jewel of mathematics, itself
the queen of the sciences.\footnote{\emph{Gauss zum Ged\"achtniss} (1856) by Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen}
However, all was not lost.
It is a quirk of cryptography that the hardness of problems can be used
to secure communication. Therefore, factoring also has immense practical
usefulness as the basis of the RSA cryptosystem, the most widely-used
cryptosystem around the world and on the internet.

The somewhat sinister political importance of factoring to
governments is the ability to gather intelligence on each other and on their
citizens. The importance to citizens is the ability to choose security
parameters so that their correspondence is protected from each other and
their governments for a limited time.
The organizers of the popular democratic uprisings in the Middle East known
as the Arab Spring in 2011 definitely benefitted from using a cryptosystem that was
secure against compromise given the resources of the regimes that they toppled.
A government able to hack the organizers' Twitter accounts or Facebook pages
could misdirect protest actions or identify activists for imprisonment.
Similarly, being able to accurately estimate the resources needed to factor
an RSA key of a certain size may help protect future citizens against
governments with a quantum computers, as governments will be the first
organizations interested in and able to afford such a device.

How can we reason about the computational resources needed to solve the
problem of factoring an $n$-bit number?
Before 1994, the best known algorithm was the
number field sieve (citation needed) which had a running time of
$exp(\sqrt[3]{log n})$. This can be considered a pre-quantum (classical)
algorithm in a pre-quantum era. Its sub-exponential (but still super-polynomial)
running time is still considered intractable.
This conjectured hardness is why users of the RSA cryptosystem above have faith
that their information is resistant to compromise, while at the same time
giving hope to mathematicians of some future improvement.

In 1994, Peter Shor fulfilled this hope in a landmark
discovery that using the more general computational power of quantum physics,
factoring could be performed in running time $O(n^3\log n \log\log n)$\cite{Shor1994}. 
This kickstarted the entire field of quantum computing; united many
disciplines including computer science, physics, engineering, and
mathematics; and provided the foundation for this dissertation.
The computational model in which this remarkable feat was achieved
made some assumptions about quantum computing devices, which are now
standard in the field.
%However, many remain skeptical of this achievement due to the perceived
%plausibility of these assumptions, which is why RSA still remains the
%most widely-used cryptosystem in the world.\footnote{Despite recommendations
%from the NSA to switch to ECC, itself susceptible to quantum attacks (citation needed).}
These assumptions include robust error-correction (to preserve fragile
quantum information against environmental noise) and high-fidelity
quantum gates (to exert reliable classical control).
Whether these assumptions can be
realized is an active area of experimental physics research, and is not the
topic of this current work. However, given that these assumptions will
eventually be realized, how can we optimize Shor's factoring algorithm?
Quantum computation is now a rapidly maturing field, and we cannot provide
an adequate background in this dissertation. The interested reader is referred
to the standard textbook in the field by Nielsen and Chuang \cite{Nielsen2000}.
Building upon this background, we can provide an introduction into the subfield
of quantum architecture with the current work.

% III. Quantum circuits and quantum architecture
First, we will introduce a quantum circuit.
Analogous to the classical circuit model, a quantum circuit consists of
a network, or graph, of gates operating on quantum bits (qubits). One can
arrange this graph such that directed edges represent qubits and
nodes represent reversible quantum gates with in-degree equal to out-degree.
See Figure \ref{fig:intro-qcirc} for a representation of a quantum circuit
as a special class of directed
acyclic graphs. All flows travel from the input state of the qubits at the
first timestep (on the far
left) to the final output state on the same qubits in the last timestep
(on the far right). This induces a natural definition of circuit depth,
size, and width, which we will make more formal later.

\end{figure}

A quantum architecture is a quantum circuit with constraints. For this
dissertation, we will concern ourselves with two main constraints:
(1) the layout graph of qubits which constrain two-qubit gate interactions and
(2) the decomposition of all single-qubit gates to a discrete, finite,
set of gates which are universal combined with a fixed two-qubit gate.
Quantum architecture provides an intermediate layer in between working
with actual hardware (the physical technology in a laboratory) and the
abstract theory (algorithms divorced of all physical constraints).
As quantum architects, we can optimize algorithms in a general way which
is relevant to many kinds of laboratory experiments. At the same time,
we can take into account the more complicated nature of physical devices
to provide more pessimistic, accurate, and numerical resource estimates than
more high-level, theoretical results.

The role of quantum architecture is two-fold. First,
to quantify and improve the resources---such as circuit depth,
size, and width mentioned above---required to run a quantum
algorithm on a system of varying degrees of realism. Second, to provide
tradeoffs between circuit resources, or conceptual knobs used to tune a
particular implementation. This allows experimentalists to configure a
quantum architecture to meet their needs in a laboratory while allowing
theorists to improve tradeoffs or design new algorithms which take
physical constraints into account.


% Point 
We are now ready to state our thesis:

\begin{quote}
Studying the depth of quantum architectures can help us design quantum
computers that can solve
human problems with a human lifetime.
\end{quote}

In particular ``a human lifetime'' means on the order of 50 years, which is
the remaining expected lifetime for a human male of the same age as the
author. This not only means that an implementation of a quantum architecture
in a laboratory should complete within 50 years, but that all resources
needed to build and power such a laboratory should also be acquirable in
50 years.

``Human problems'' in this dissertation is exemplified by the special-case of
factoring. We will optimize the circuit resources for Shor's algorithm mapped
to a specific quantum architecture with the hope of discovering general
principles that can be applied to other quantum algorithms in the future.

``Studying the depth'' of quantum architectures is meant to
make progress towards answering several questions.
First, is it possible to improve circuit depth, at the cost of all
other circuit resources, for a factoring architecture
beyond currently known results?
Second, what is the optimal depth possible?
Third, what tradeoffs are introduced between depth and other circuit
resources? Finally, what is the most relevant of these tradeoffs?
Achieving minimal depth may require materials or energy beyond
human abilities to acquire within the 50 years quoted above. Even ignoring the
important concerns of scalable error-correction and high-fidelity control,
we can ask the question ``Can a quantum factoring machine be built?'' in
terms of physical resources alone.

 Therefore,
in support of this thesis,
our dissertation will investigate both low-depth factoring architectures
as well as characterizing their circuit resource tradeoffs.
Our results will represent progress towards a more realistic, configurable
quantum factoring architecture.

\section{Organization of Dissertation}
\label{sec:intro-org}

The remainder of this chapter is devoted to the necessary background needed
to understand quantum architecture in general and factoring architectures
in particular. Quantum architecture has potentially many concerns, but we
focus on two of them: interaction distance and fault-tolerant quantum compiling.
Without loss of generality, the gates of a quantum circuit can be reduced to
single-qubit and two-qubit gates, called a circuit basis.
In fact, we can use a fixed two-qubit gate
and combine it with arbitrary single-qubit gates.
Section \ref{sec:intro-basis} provides the necessary background for
understanding circuit bases and single-qubit gates,
which do not impose any constraints on
which qubits can interact with each other. Section \ref{sec:intro-arch}
defines quantum architectures and architectural models in more detail using
both a fixed, finite basis in both single-qubit and two-qubit operations
and imposing connectivity constraints on the two-qubit operations.
Section \ref{sec:intro-cdc} introduces recent constant-depth techniques
for simulating long-distance interactions with nearest-neighbor
interactions, using linear size and width. Constant-depth communication
introduces a tradeoff between depth and the other two resources. Specifically,
reducing depth raises the possibility that more circuit resources are
devoted to communication than to computation. This tradeoff is examined 
in more detail in Section \ref{sec:intro-modules}
by introducing the notion of a module and hybrid nearest-neighbor
quantum architectures.

After this chapter, the remainder of this dissertation is organized to
examine and expound upon the thesis statement above. In the first two
chapters, we focus on improving the depth of factoring architectures
in our hybrid 2D nearest-neighbor model using parallelization and
constant-depth communication. In contrast to nearest-neighbor factoring
architectures, we will refer to our results as hybrid factoring architectures,
or simply hybrid factoring.
Chapter \ref{chap:factor-polylog} presents our first main result:
hybrid factoring in polylogarithmic depth.
Chapter \ref{chap:factor-sublog} presents a further exponential improvement
in our second main result: hybrid factoring in sublogarithmic depth.

At this point, we have run into a seemingly fundamental limit on improving
hybrid factoring to be constant depth: the compilation of arbitrary
single-qubit gates to a fault-tolerant basis. We examine this
\emph{quantum compiling} limit in Chapter \ref{chap:qcompile}. First we
present a background of quantum compiling and a survey of the current
state-of-the-art in related literature to provide context. Then, in our
third main result, we improve
upon the Kitaev-Shen-Vyalyi procedure for generating quantum Fourier states,
a vital subproblem for single-qubit quantum compiling.

Finally, we change directions and question the approach of minimizing depth
at all costs in the first two chapters. We argue that the most relevant
tradeoff to consider along with decreasing depth is the increasing amount
of error-correcting effort needed to maintain a useful quantum state for
computation. Therefore we introduce a new resource called
\emph{circuit coherence} in Chapter \ref{chap:coherence}. In this chapter,
we explore circuit coherence and its relationship to other circuit resources
in the hybrid model as well as other models of computation. In our final
main result, we show the connection between the circuit coherence for a
layered quantum circuit and a reversible pebble game, for which existing
time-space tradeoffs are known.

Finally we conclude our dissertation in Chapter \ref{chap:conclude} with a
summary of our main results along with related open conjectures and
directions for future research.
