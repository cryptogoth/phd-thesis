	Abstract = {We show that the depth of quantum circuits in a realistic architecture where a classical controller determines which local interactions to apply on the (k)D grid ($\backslash$bbZ\^{}k) where (k $\backslash$geq 2) is the same (up to a constant factor) as in the standard model where arbitrary interactions are allowed. This allows minimum-depth circuits for the nearest-neighbor architecture to be obtained from minimum-depth circuits in the standard abstract model. Our work therefore justifies the standard assumption that quantum algorithms can perform interactions between arbitrary pairs of qubits. In particular, our results imply that Shor's algorithm, controlled operations and fan-outs can be implemented in constant depth, polynomial size and polynomial width in this architecture.   We also present optimal non-adaptive quantum circuits for controlled operations and fan-outs on a (k)D grid. These circuits have depth ($\backslash$Theta($\backslash$sqrt[k]\{n\})), size ($\backslash$Theta(n)) and width ($\backslash$Theta(n)). Our lower bound is for a general class of operations which includes controlled operations and fan-outs as special cases.},

Classically, we need logarithmic depth even if we can use unbounded fan-in gates. If we allow arbitrary one-qubit gates instead of a fixed basis, then these circuits can also be made exact in log-star depth.

@article{Bonderson2010,
	Abstract = {The advancement of information processing into the realm of quantum mechanics promises a transcendence in computational power that will enable problems to be solved which are completely beyond the known abilities of any "classical" computer, including any potential non-quantum technologies the future may bring. However, the fragility of quantum states poses a challenging obstacle for realization of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The topological approach to quantum computation proposes to surmount this obstacle by using special physical systems -- non-Abelian topologically ordered phases of matter -- that would provide intrinsic fault-tolerance at the hardware level. The so-called "Ising-type" non-Abelian topological order is likely to be physically realized in a number of systems, but it can only provide a universal gate set (a requisite for quantum computation) if one has the ability to perform certain dynamical topology-changing operations on the system. Until now, practical methods of implementing these operations were unknown. Here we show how the necessary operations can be physically implemented for Ising-type systems realized in the recently proposed superconductor-semiconductor and superconductor-topological insulator heterostructures. Furthermore, we specify routines employing these methods to generate a computationally universal gate set. We are consequently able to provide a schematic blueprint for a fully topologically-protected Ising based quantum computer using currently available materials and techniques. This may serve as a starting point for attempts to construct a fault-tolerant quantum computer, which will have applications to cryptanalysis, drug design, efficient simulation of quantum many-body systems, solution of large systems of linear equations, searching large databases, engineering future quantum computers, and -- most importantly -- those applications which no one in our classical era has the prescience to foresee.},

Two main mechanisms that caused motional excitation during transport are explained, along with the methods used to mitigate such excitation. We reduced the motional excitation below the results in Ref. [1] by a factor of approximately 50. The effect of a mu-metal shield on qubit coherence is also reported. Finally, we examined a method for exchanging energy between multiple motional modes on the few-quanta level, which could be useful for cooling motional modes without directly accessing the modes with lasers. These results establish how trapped ions can be transported in a large-scale quantum processor with high fidelity.},

	Abstract = {We prove that one-way quantum computations have the same computational power as quantum circuits with unbounded fan-out. It demonstrates that the one-way model is not only one of the most promising models of physical realisation, but also a very powerful model of quantum computation. It confirms and completes previous results which have pointed out, for some specific problems, a depth separation between the one-way model and the quantum circuit model. Since one-way model has the same computational power as unbounded quantum fan-out circuits, the quantum Fourier transform can be approximated in constant depth in the one-way model, and thus the factorisation can be done by a polytime probabilistic classical algorithm which has access to a constant-depth one-way quantum computer. The extra power of the one-way model, comparing with the quantum circuit model, comes from its classical-quantum hybrid nature. We show that this extra power is reduced to the capability to perform unbounded classical parity gates in constant depth.},

Previously, the linear-depth ripple-carry addition circuit has been the method of choice.

@unpublished{Choi2010,
	Abstract = {In this work, we propose an adder for the 2D NTC architecture, designed to match the architectural constraints of many quantum computing technologies. The chosen architecture allows the layout of logical qubits in two dimensions and the concurrent execution of one- and two-qubit gates with nearest-neighbor interaction only. The proposed adder works in three phases. In the first phase, the first column generates the summation output and the other columns do the carry-lookahead operations. In the second phase, these intermediate values are propagated from column to column, preparing for computation of the final carry for each register position. In the last phase, each column, except the first one, generates the summation output using this column-level carry. The depth and the number of qubits of the proposed adder are \$\backslash Theta(\backslash sqrt\{n\})\$ and O(n), respectively. The proposed adder executes faster than the adders designed for the 1D NTC architecture when the length of the input registers \$n\$ is larger than 58.},

@article{Fowler2004,
	Abstract = {Shor's algorithm, which given appropriate hardware can factorise an integer \$N\$ in a time polynomial in its binary length \$L\$, has arguable spurred the race to build a practical quantum computer. Several different quantum circuits implementing Shor's algorithm have been designed, but each tacitly assumes that arbitrary pairs of qubits within the computer can be interacted. While some quantum computer architectures possess this property, many promising proposals are best suited to realising a single line of qubits with nearest neighbour interactions only. In light of this, we present a circuit implementing Shor's factorisation algorithm designed for such a linear nearest neighbour architecture. Despite the interaction restrictions, the circuit requires just \$2L+4\$ qubits and to first order requires \$8L\^{}\{4\}\$ gates arranged in a circuit of depth \$32L\^{}\{3\}\$ -- identical to first order to that possible using an architecture that can interact arbitrary pairs of qubits.},

Using the circuit, we then propose a method for constructing an O(d(n))-depth O(n)-size quantum circuit for addition with O(n/d(n)) ancillary qubits for any d(n)=$\backslash$Omega(log n). If we are allowed to use unbounded fan-out gates with length O(n\^{}c) for an arbitrary small positive constant c, we can modify the method and construct an O(e(n))-depth O(n)-size circuit with o(n) ancillary qubits for any e(n)=$\backslash$Omega(log* n). In particular, these methods yield efficient circuits with depth O(log n) and with depth O(log* n), respectively. We apply our circuits to constructing efficient quantum circuits for Shor's discrete logarithm algorithm.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the impact on modular exponentiation of architectural features and possible concurrent gate execution. Various arithmetic algorithms are evaluated for execution time, potential concurrency, and space tradeoffs. We find that, to exponentiate an n-bit number, for storage space 100n (twenty times the minimum 5n), we can execute modular exponentiation two hundred to seven hundred times faster than optimized versions of the basic algorithms, depending on architecture, for n=128. Addition on a neighbor-only architecture is limited to O(n) time when non-neighbor architectures can reach O(log n), demonstrating that physical characteristics of a computing device have an important impact on both real-world running time and asymptotic behavior. Our results will help guide experimental implementations of quantum algorithms and devices.},

	Abstract = {Universal quantum computation (UQC) using Majorana fermions on a 2D topological superconducting (TS) medium remains an outstanding open problem. This is because the quantum gate set that can be generated by braiding of the Majorana fermions does not include $\backslash$emph\{any\} two-qubit gate and also the single-qubit \$\backslash pi/8\$ phase gate. In principle, it is possible to create these crucial extra gates using quantum interference of Majorana fermion currents. However, it is not clear if the motion of the various order parameter defects (vortices, domain walls, $\backslash$emph\{etc.\}), to which the Majorana fermions are bound in a TS medium, can be quantum coherent. We show that these obstacles can be overcome using a semiconductor quantum wire network in the vicinity of an \$s\$-wave superconductor, by constructing topologically protected two-qubit gates and any arbitrary single-qubit phase gate in a topologically unprotected manner, which can be error corrected using magic state distillation. Thus our strategy, using a judicious combination of topologically protected and unprotected gate operations, realizes UQC on a quantum wire network with a remarkably high error threshold of \$0.14\$ as compared to \$10\^{}\{-3\}\$ to \$10\^{}\{-4\}\$ in ordinary unprotected quantum computation.},

In particular, we provide for the first time a full characterization of patterns with flow of arbitrary depth, based on the notion of influencing paths and a simple rewriting system on the angles of the measurement. Our method leads to insightful knowledge for constructing parallel circuits and as applications, we demonstrate several constant and logarithmic depth circuits.

We examine techniques for constructing arbitrary gates which perform substantially faster than circuits based on the conventional Solovay-Kitaev algorithm [C.M. Dawson and M.A. Nielsen, $\backslash$emph\{Quantum Inf. Comput.\}, $\backslash$textbf\{6\}:81, 2006].

Moreover, we construct and analyze efficient implementations of first- and second-quantized simulation algorithms using the fault-tolerant arbitrary gates and other techniques, such as implementing various subroutines in constant time. A specific example we analyze is the ground-state energy calculation for Lithium hydride.},

@article{Takahashi2011,
abstract = {We investigate the computational power of constant-depth polynomial-size quantum circuits with unbounded fan-out gates in the exact setting, where quantum circuits output the correct answer with certainty. We show that there exists an O(1)-depth O(n log n)-size quantum circuit for the OR function on n bits. This is an affirmative answer to the question of Hoyer and Spalek and implies that QNC\^{}0\_f=QAC\^{}0\_f in contrast to the fact that NC\^{}0 $\backslash$subsetneq AC\^{}0, where QNC\^{}0\_f and QAC\^{}0\_f are the quantum circuit complexity classes corresponding to the classical ones NC\^{}0 and AC\^{}0, respectively. We also show that there exists an O(1)-depth small-size quantum circuit for the threshold function on n bits with a threshold 1 $\backslash$leq t $\backslash$leq n, where the size is O(n log n) when t is close to 1 or n, and it is O(n sqrt\{n log n\}) when t is around n/2.},

@article{Dawson2005,
abstract = {This pedagogical review presents the proof of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem in the form of an efficient classical algorithm for compiling an arbitrary single-qubit gate into a sequence of gates from a fixed and finite set. The algorithm can be used, for example, to compile Shor's algorithm, which uses rotations of \$\backslash pi / 2\^{}k\$, into an efficient fault-tolerant form using only Hadamard, controlled-\{$\backslash$sc not\}, and \$\backslash pi / 8\$ gates. The algorithm runs in \$O(\backslash log\^{}\{2.71\}(1/\backslash epsilon))\$ time, and produces as output a sequence of \$O(\backslash log\^{}\{3.97\}(1/\backslash epsilon))\$ quantum gates which is guaranteed to approximate the desired quantum gate to an accuracy within \$\backslash epsilon > 0\$. We also explain how the algorithm can be generalized to apply to multi-qubit gates and to gates from \$SU(d)\$.},

@article{Beals2012,
abstract = {We provide algorithms for efficiently addressing quantum memory in parallel. These imply that the standard circuit model can be simulated with low overhead by the more realistic model of a distributed quantum computer. As a result, the circuit model can be used by algorithm designers without worrying whether the underlying architecture supports the connectivity of the circuit. In addition, we apply our results to existing memory intensive quantum algorithms. We present a parallel quantum search algorithm and improve the time-space trade-off for the Element Distinctness and Collision problems.},
